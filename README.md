## Introduction
The auto-table-extract system is capable of identifying tablular data within PDF documents and extracting all the tabular information into an excel  file. 

Table detection is the process of identifying tables from a document, extracting the cells contained in a table. 

The auto-table-extract system consists of three main modules: 1) Document conversion 2) Layout Analysis 3) Table detection and extraction.

**The two methods used for identification and extraction are:**

1) Table_with_Border ( For tables with fully recognizable borders)
The Table_with_Border method is used to determine the tables with the help of coordinates of text lines, characters, and text boxes provided by the PDFMiner. 

2) Table_without_Border (For partially bordered or borderless tables ). 
The Table_without_Border method uses the clustering method and coordinates of the text line to determine the table and extract its contents.


Further, a Pandas DataFrame consisting of extracted data is created, which is used to make the excel sheet containing the data. The output of the auto-table-extract system is an Excel document with the tableâ€™s information extracted from the PDF.
